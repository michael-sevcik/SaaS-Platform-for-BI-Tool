# stage.

# It will also use whatever happens to be the most recent version of that tag when you
# build your Dockerfile. If reproducability is important, consider using a more specific
# version (e.g., aspnet:7.0.10-alpine-3.18),
# or SHA (e.g., mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet@sha256:f3d99f54d504a21d38e4cc2f13ff47d67235efeeb85c109d3d1ff1808b38d034).
